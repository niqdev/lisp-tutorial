;;; The N'th triangular number is defined to be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N.
;;; Alternatively, we could give a recursive definition of triangular number as follows:
;;; T(n) = 1 if n = 1
;;; T(n) = n + T(n-1) if n > 1
;;; Use the recursive definition to help you implement a linearly recursive function
;;; (triangular N) that returns the N'th triangular number.
